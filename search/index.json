[{"content":"Chatting in real-time invovled server-client communication. PHP web is best for CRUD operation, but it is inefficient for chatting, as the client need to pool against the server for new data periodically. This would not scale for the server against the growth of user base.\nThis is where Node.JS/Express/MongoDB/Socket.io comes in. The tech stack allows distribute system.\nWhile digging into these, I realized that Erlang/OTP (Open Telecom Platform) was developed for this purpose. I could say that this is a specialized programming language. It purpose is to have a hot-swappable code, it allow processes to run forever without downtime. It solves distributed system. Real-world application like WhatsApp and Facebook chat use this solution. However it is inefficient for CRUD operation (is it?)\n","date":"2018-03-16","permalink":"https://serenitylife.xyz/blog/my-naive-thoughts-of-crud-and-chat-systems/","tags":null,"title":"My Naive Thoughts of Crud and Chat Systems"},{"content":"Hadoop: A set of open source programs and procedures which anyone can use as the \u0026ldquo;backbone\u0026rdquo; of their big data operations.\nThe four module of Hadoop\nDistributed File-System MapReduce Hadoop Common YARN Distributed File-System The most important two are Distributed File System and MapReduce Distributed File System in Hadoop system uses its own file system that \u0026ldquo;sit above\u0026rdquo; the file system.
